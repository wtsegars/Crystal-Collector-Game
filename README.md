# Crystal-Collector-Game
This is a Legend of Zelda-themed crystal collector game that utilizes basic JavaScript along with jQuery to function. The object of this game is to click on a series of four crystals (rupees from the Legend of Zelda games) that are equal to a random number that is not disclosed to the player. The object of the game is to click on the crystals so that each of the values of the crystals that are clicked on will add up to be equal to the number that appears on screen at the begining of the game. If the the value of all of the clicks is equal to the number that is on the screen, then the player wins the game. If the value of all of the clicks is not equal to the number that is already on the screen, then the player will lose the game. Regardless if the player wins or loses, the page will refresh with a random new value that appears on screen along with random new values for the four crystals.
