    <h1>Rupee Number Guessing Game</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="text">This is you standard crystal number guessing game, only it is a little different. Instead of 
       using the usual crystals for this game, you will be using Rupees from the popular Legends of 
       Zelda games. For those of you who don't know, Rupees are the currency that is used throughout 
       the Legends of Zelda games and they generally appear in the form of crystals. Wow! Who wouldn't 
       want crystals as money?</p>
       <br><br>
    <p class="text">The object of this game is to click on one of three differently colored Rupees that will 
        randomly correspond with a number. You will not be able to see the number until you click 
        on one of the Rupees, which will cause the number value assigned to that Rupee to be added 
        to your score. What you are trying to do is to get the total of your score to be equal to 
        the number that is presented above the Rupees. Once you do this you will win the game; otherwise, 
        you will lose the game. 
       </p>
